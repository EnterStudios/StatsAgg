 * OpenTSDB performance improvements -- most noticeable under high load scenarios
 * Graphite performance improvements -- most noticeable under high load scenarios
 * Minor OpenTSDB 'send previous value' improvements
 * Security improvements
 * Bugfix for Graphite-Agg & StatsD -- metric values being output to OpenTSDB and/or Graphite could have been improperly formatted

StatsAgg 1.1  - released 2015-03-27
 * If you upgrading from StatsAgg 1.0, then you will need to run the SQL found in "Upgrade to 1.1.txt" against your StatsAgg database
   * Located @ StatsAgg\WEB-INF\sql
 * Swapped out WebUI table column-filtering library -- the previous one had some form of incompatibility with the column visibility plugin
   * Now using yadcf - https://github.com/vedmack/yadcf
 * Added alert acknowledgements
   * Acknowledge alerts in the WebUI. Shows someone 'acknowledged' it, and prevents additional alert notification (unless unacknowledged)
 * 3 column 'alert details' page -- more readable
 * 'Details' pages now link to other 'details' pages
 * Separated the metric 'cleanup routine' from the 'alert routine'. This should greatly reduce the risk of out-of-memory issues on StatsAgg startup.
 * Changed some boolean values in the tables & details pages to 'Yes' / 'No' (more professional looking)
 * Improvements to how word-wrapping & line-breaking behaviour for all pages in the WebUI
 * Changed the default port for the Graphite-Aggregation listener to port 22003
   * This was done to avoid confusion with the Graphite-Pickle listener (which is on port 2004 in the actual Graphite program) 
 * OpenTSDB support...
   * Incoming metrics on the telnet interface (User-defined port, default 4242)
   * Incoming metrics on the HTTP interface (Same as Tomcat port. See the manual for more info)
   * Outgoing metrics on the telnet interface (User-defined port, default 4242)
 * Reduced Netty shutdown time to 30sec. This should shorten the overall time that it takes to stop Tomcat.
 * Documentation improvements
