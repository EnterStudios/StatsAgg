StatsAgg 1.3  - released 2015-xx-xx
 * Added new properties to an alert -- 'first triggered at' timestamp for caution & danger
 * Resent email notifications include a field that says how long the alert has been triggered
 * New WebUI view -- 'Metric Group - Alert Associations'. This page allows a user to see every alert that is associated with a particular 'metric group'.
   * Accessible via the 'Metric Group Details' page
 * The Graphite-Aggregation routine now outputs 3 additional aggregated fields: Sum, Count, Median
 * Saving StatsD gauges to the database is now optional.
   * This allows users to configure StatsAgg to behave as StatsD behaves
 * Altering a property of an alert that doesn't affect caution/danger trigger status will no longer reset the trigger status
   * In other words, you can change alert fields like 'description' and 'alert on positive' without losing your caution/danger triggered statuses
 * Altering a 'metric group' will not force the metric-group to go through the association routine unless one or more of the regular expressions have changed
   * In other words, you can change 'metric group' fields like 'description' and 'tags' without losing your metric-key associations
 * Cloned alerts now default to being disabled.
 * Run the 'metric association routine' immediately after making a 'metric group' change
 * Run the 'alert routine' immediately after making an alert change
 * Smarter handling around 'forgetting metrics'. Removes some conditions that could lead to a metric not being fully 'forgotten'.
 * Significant re-factoring of the metric-cleanup routine. Should be faster & simpler.
 * In the WebUI, large tables will not be displayed until the 'datatables' javascript library is fully initialized.
 * Converted 'Alert Suspension Details' page into panel-based UI
 * Standardized font size of WebUI page bodies at 12pt
 * Minor tweaks to several WebUI pages


StatsAgg 1.2  - released 2015-04-27
 * Performance & memory utilization improvements -- most noticeable under high load scenarios
 * Added a new OpenTSDB HTTP listener. By default, it will listen on "http://statsagg-hostname.com:4243"
     This listener operates outside of the Tomcat container & does not have an application context. 
     This is now the recommended way to get metrics into OpenTSDB via HTTP. The Tomcat listener (same port/context as the WebUI) is still supported, but not recommended.
 * Added support for reading OpenTSDB metrics that were sent with gzip compression 
 * Added support for StatsD histograms
 * Added support for sample-rates on StatsD timers
 * Tweaks to many WebUI pages
   * Friendly messages when page input parameters aren't valid.
   * Applied formatting to the list of email addresses in 'Notification Groups' & 'Notification Group Details'
 * WebUI -- Added support for doing a search on a table based off a uri parameter. Allows immediate filtering of the table on page load. Applies to all tables.
 * 'One time' alert suspensions are now allowed to suspend an alert indefinitely. Previously they were limited to 24 hours.
 * Minor OpenTSDB 'send previous value' improvements
 * Lowered the thread priority of alert-routine threads
 * Minor security improvements
 * Bugfix to OpenTSDB -- it will now reject metrics that have tags with duplicate tag-keys
 * Bugfix for Graphite-Agg & StatsD -- metric values being output to OpenTSDB and/or Graphite could have been improperly formatted

 
StatsAgg 1.1  - released 2015-03-27
 * If you upgrading from StatsAgg 1.0, then you will need to run the SQL found in "Upgrade to 1.1.txt" against your StatsAgg database
   * Located @ StatsAgg\WEB-INF\sql
 * Swapped out WebUI table column-filtering library -- the previous one had some form of incompatibility with the column visibility plugin
   * Now using yadcf - https://github.com/vedmack/yadcf
 * Added alert acknowledgements
   * Acknowledge alerts in the WebUI. Shows someone 'acknowledged' it, and prevents additional alert notification (unless unacknowledged)
 * 3 column 'alert details' page -- more readable
 * 'Details' pages now link to other 'details' pages
 * Separated the metric 'cleanup routine' from the 'alert routine'. This should greatly reduce the risk of out-of-memory issues on StatsAgg startup.
 * Changed some boolean values in the tables & details pages to 'Yes' / 'No' (more professional looking)
 * Improvements to how word-wrapping & line-breaking behaviour for all pages in the WebUI
 * Changed the default port for the Graphite-Aggregation listener to port 22003
   * This was done to avoid confusion with the Graphite-Pickle listener (which is on port 2004 in the actual Graphite program) 
 * OpenTSDB support...
   * Incoming metrics on the telnet interface (User-defined port, default 4242)
   * Incoming metrics on the HTTP interface (Same as Tomcat port. See the manual for more info)
   * Outgoing metrics on the telnet interface (User-defined port, default 4242)
 * Reduced Netty shutdown time to 30sec. This should shorten the overall time that it takes to stop Tomcat.
 * Documentation improvements
