StatsAgg 1.2  - released 2015-xx-xx
 * Performance & memory utilization improvements -- most noticeable under high load scenarios
 * Added a new OpenTSDB HTTP listener. This listener listens on port 4243 by default. 
   This is now the recommended way to get metrics into OpenTSDB via HTTP. The Tomcat listener (same port as the WebUI) is still supported, but not recommended.
 * Added support for OpenTSDB compression on metric-sending
 * Added support for StatsD histograms
 * Added Support for sample-rates on StatsD timers
 * Tweaks to many WebUI pages
   * Friendly messages when page input parameters aren't valid.
   * Applied formatting to the list of email addresses in 'Notification Groups' & 'Notification Group Details'
 * WebUI -- Added support for doing a search on a table based off a uri parameter. Allows immediate filtering of the table on page load. Applies to all tables.
 * Minor OpenTSDB 'send previous value' improvements
 * Lowered the thread priority of alert-routine threads
 * Minor security improvements
 * Bugfix to OpenTSDB -- it will now reject metrics that have tags with duplicate tag-keys
 * Bugfix for Graphite-Agg & StatsD -- metric values being output to OpenTSDB and/or Graphite could have been improperly formatted

 
StatsAgg 1.1  - released 2015-03-27
 * If you upgrading from StatsAgg 1.0, then you will need to run the SQL found in "Upgrade to 1.1.txt" against your StatsAgg database
   * Located @ StatsAgg\WEB-INF\sql
 * Swapped out WebUI table column-filtering library -- the previous one had some form of incompatibility with the column visibility plugin
   * Now using yadcf - https://github.com/vedmack/yadcf
 * Added alert acknowledgements
   * Acknowledge alerts in the WebUI. Shows someone 'acknowledged' it, and prevents additional alert notification (unless unacknowledged)
 * 3 column 'alert details' page -- more readable
 * 'Details' pages now link to other 'details' pages
 * Separated the metric 'cleanup routine' from the 'alert routine'. This should greatly reduce the risk of out-of-memory issues on StatsAgg startup.
 * Changed some boolean values in the tables & details pages to 'Yes' / 'No' (more professional looking)
 * Improvements to how word-wrapping & line-breaking behaviour for all pages in the WebUI
 * Changed the default port for the Graphite-Aggregation listener to port 22003
   * This was done to avoid confusion with the Graphite-Pickle listener (which is on port 2004 in the actual Graphite program) 
 * OpenTSDB support...
   * Incoming metrics on the telnet interface (User-defined port, default 4242)
   * Incoming metrics on the HTTP interface (Same as Tomcat port. See the manual for more info)
   * Outgoing metrics on the telnet interface (User-defined port, default 4242)
 * Reduced Netty shutdown time to 30sec. This should shorten the overall time that it takes to stop Tomcat.
 * Documentation improvements
