StatsAgg 1.1  - released 2015-xx-xx
 * If you are using StatsAgg 1.0, then you will need to run the commands found in "Upgrade to 1.1.txt" @ https://github.com/PearsonEducation/StatsAgg/tree/master/sql
 * Reduced Netty shutdown time to 30sec
 * Swapped out WebUI table column-filtering library -- the previous one had some form of incompatibility with the column visibility plugin
   * Now using yadcf - https://github.com/vedmack/yadcf
 * Added alert acknowledgements
   * Acknowledge alerts in the WebUI. Shows someone 'acknowledged' it, and prevents additional alert notification (unless unacknowledged)
 * 3 column 'alert details' page -- more readable
 * 'Details' pages now link to other 'details' pages
 * Separated the metric 'cleanup routine' from the 'alert routine'. This should greatly reduce the risk of out-of-memory issues on StatsAgg startup.
 * Changed some boolean values in the tables & details pages to 'Yes' / 'No' (more professional looking)
 * Improvements to how word-wrapping is handled in the WebUI
 * Tweaked line-breaking behaviour on all pages.
 * Changed the default port for the Graphite-Aggregation listener to port 22003
   * This was done to avoid confusion with the Graphite-Pickle listener (which is on port 2004 in the actual Graphite program) 
 * OpenTSDB support...
   * Incoming metrics on the telnet interface (User-defined port, default 4242)
   * Incoming metrics on the http interface (Same as Tomcat port. See the manual for more info)
   * Outgoing metrics on the telnet interface (user-defined port, default 4242)
 * Documentation improvements
