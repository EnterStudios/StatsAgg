StatsAgg 1.1
 * Reduced Netty shutdown time to 30sec
 * Swapped out WebUI table column-filtering library -- the previous one had some form of incompatibility with the column visibility plugin
   * Now using yadcf - https://github.com/vedmack/yadcf
 * Added alert acknowledgements
   * Acknowledge alerts in the WebUI. Shows someone 'acknowledged' it, and prevents additional alert notification (unless unacknowledged)
 * 3 column 'alert details' page -- more readable
 * 'Details' pages now link to other 'details' pages
 * Separated the metric cleanup routine from the alert routine. This should greatly reduce the risk of out-of-memory issues on StatsAgg startup.
 * Changed some boolean values in the tables to 'Yes' / 'No' (more professional looking)
 * Improvements to how word-wrapping is handled in the WebUI
 * OpenTSDB support...
   * Incoming metrics on the telnet interface
   * Outgoing metrics on the telnet interface
