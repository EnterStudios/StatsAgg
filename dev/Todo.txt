StatsAgg 1.2
 * Retest 'resend previous value' for all formats
 * Implement/document/test timers with sample rates
 * Document that we don't support sample rate with timers (yet)
 * Document security benefits of using StatsAgg for OpenTSDB
 * Unit test output format conversions
 * OpenTSDB HTTP on a separate port from Tomcat WebUI

Short/Medium term
 * Last received metric in WebUI
 * Convert 'Alert Suspension Details' page into panel-based UI
 * OpenTSDB -- send back a list of 'metrics with errors' on HTTP requests with the 'details' parameter
 * OpenTSDB SSL for HTTP interface
 * StatsD histograms
 * StatsD forwarder
 * Control what StatsD 'timer' fields are outputted (so people can ignore the more useless ones)
 * Advanced options
   * New application config option -- limit metric results # in WebUI
   * Maximum concurrently running output-threads
   * Output-thread timeout
   * Cleanup metrics after... (currently hardcoded to 24hrs)
 * Debug mode for "details" pages (include additional details)
 * Manual injection of metrics via a new servlet
 * Stop resending metric after X time of no updates
 * "Event Listener" API -- for anything that wants to use StatsAgg to send an alert, but also wants to tie into 'Alert Suspensions'
 
Long term
 * APIs to create alerts / metric-groups / etc
 * Mobile versions of essential WebUI pages
   * Make existing pages more mobile friendly?
 * Flot graphs on 'Recent Metric Values' page
 * Native InfluxDB support
 * Support Graphite Pickle format
 * Migrate connection pool to HikariCP
 * Support output via OpenTSDB HTTP/JSON
 * Events log w/ UI component
 * Server-side WebUI tables
 * Calculator (add/multiply/etc) all the most recent values of a metric group)?
 * Alert by individual metric?
 * Convert to a regular Java app & use embedded Tomcat for the WebUI
   * Prereq for simplifying installation
 * When altering alerts & 'stuff is in an alerted status', don't null the alert status if the alert status is the same.
   * May require substantial refactoring
